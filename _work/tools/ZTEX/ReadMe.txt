GothicZTEX 2.6
==============

What for...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This tool is intended to convert the compressed
textures of the Gothic II Add-On (v2.6) back to
TGA files (including directories).

Preparation
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
At first expand the following VDFS volumes to
your harddrive (if not already done):
[g2addon]\Data\Textures.vdf
[g2addon]\Data\Textures_Addon.vdf

note: you may use GothicVDFS for this task.

Usage
¯¯¯¯¯
Select the path ([g2addon]\_work\data\Textures)
and press the "Convert" button.

Comments
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
In the Add-On the Loading.tga + StartScreen.tga
are now placed in [textures]/Desktop/nomip_16bit.
You should disable (rename to .tga.bak) the old
versions in [textures]/Desktop/nomip because it
is not allowed to have files with identical names
in the texture folder (and subfolders).

You'll never (mostly) get the original image
back because of the DXTC/S3TC compression.

The images are not scaled to its original size.
However, this is not a big problem (only few).
